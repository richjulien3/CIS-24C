    "\n",
    "1. You can add a new cell by clicking on the \"+\" icon on top.\n",
    "2. You can delete a cell by selecting that cell and clicking on the \"scissors\" icon on top.\n",
    "3. You can execute a cell by either pressing shift+enter or selecting the \"play\" button on top.\n",
    "4. You can create a new file in Jupyter via the File menu->New Notebook option. Make sure to select Python 2 when creating your notebook.\n",
    "5. Also, for your code blocks make sure that Code is selected instead of another option like Markdown.\n",
    "6. Use the Enter key to go to the next line in a cell to enter the next statement.\n",
    "7. You can clear results by clicking on the Cell menu item and selecting Current Output->Clear or All Output->Clear depending on whether you are trying to just clear the output for one cell or for all cells.\n",
    "8. In case your program has crashed for some reason (infinite loop, for example), you can restart your Python session by select Kernel in the menu and selecting Restart.\n"

A function is an abstraction that allows you to avoid overly complex or detailed code through a division of labor where you can quickly or easily call a simple term that executes another set of code to perform operations to achieve your goals without having to encode it all yourself.  \n",
    "2. The advantage of using a function in Python is all around simplifying the overall program.  By using a function you can abstract the performance of sections of code and avoid long and complicated processing by calling code that has been written previously to perform an operation or set of operation.  This allows you to modularize or componentize your code and reuse previously created components to perform tasks."
